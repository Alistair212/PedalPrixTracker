# Pedal Prix Tracker 2019
Script for easy display of multiple car's Pedal Prix live score on race day, this program is written in AutoIT (Open Source) and can be downloaded from its official site (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/). This program can only run on Microsoft Windows.

## What is it?
Pedal Prix Tracker is a program built using AutoIT that highlights and switches between the specified names of cars for Pedal Prix Races so that teams can keep track of their efforts on race day.

## How does it Work?
Pedal Prix Tracker works by first entering the names of the cars that you want to monitor throughout the race, plugging in a TV or monitor on race day and connecting the laptop to it is most often how it's used. It will then emulate the keyboard typing in CTRL + F (Find) and then the team name, this will highlight the entry on the live scores page and will swtich between the names inputted.

The device running the script wont be able to be used but the script will pause when something else is being done on the computer.

## How do I get it?
There are 2 ways to get the script, either by copying the text and putting it into AutoIT where you are able to compile it yourself and make changes, or by downloading the compiled .exe
### Download AutoIT and Edit the Script
Either download AutoIT (and I recommend the SciTE editor), copy the code from the most updated github file, change the default variables and you should be ready to go. This also allows you to edit the code and change it.
### Download the compiled .exe 
Download the latest.exe from the project page to get started with the default variables. As this program emulates a keyboard it may be identified as malware by your Browser & Windows Defender. If you are unable to continue I recommend downloading AutoIT and copying the script from the project page.
